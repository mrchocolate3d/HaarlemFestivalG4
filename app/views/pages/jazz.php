                Patronaat is one of the top 10 music venues in the Netherlands.
                The Haarlemsezaal has existed since 1984 and nowadays presents a distinctive program of bands and electronic music.
                It is located at the Zijlsingel in Haarlem, near the city centre.

                In 2003 the old building was replaced with a brand new concert hall, which was used for the first time in 2005.
