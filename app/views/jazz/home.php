                    Patronaat is one of the top 10 music venues in the Netherlands.
                    The Haarlemsezaal has existed since 1984 and nowadays presents a distinctive program of bands and electronic music.
                    It is located at the Zijlsingel in Haarlem, near the city centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2003 the old building was replaced with a brand new concert hall, which was used for the first time in 2005.
